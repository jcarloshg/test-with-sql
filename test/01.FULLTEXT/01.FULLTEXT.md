# FULLTEXT Search Implementation üöÄ

This project demonstrates the implementation of MySQL's FULLTEXT search functionality for efficient text-based queries on product data within a complete e-commerce database structure.

## Overview üìñ

FULLTEXT search is a MySQL feature that allows for fast and efficient searching of text content within columns. It's particularly useful for searching large amounts of text data and provides better performance than traditional `LIKE` queries.

## Project Structure üìÅ

The implementation includes:

- **Docker Setup**: MySQL 8.0 container with automatic database initialization
- **Database Schema**: Complete e-commerce structure with users, products, stock, and reservations
- **Sample Data**: Over 2000 products with diverse names and descriptions
- **FULLTEXT Implementation**: Optimized search on product names and descriptions

## Implementation Details üõ†Ô∏è

### Complete Database Schema üóÑÔ∏è

The project includes a comprehensive database structure:

**Products Table:**

- `uuid`: Primary key (VARCHAR(36)) üîë
- `name`: Product name (VARCHAR(255)) üè∑Ô∏è
- `description`: Product description (TEXT) üìù
- `price`: Product price (DECIMAL(10,2)) üí≤

**Additional Tables:**

- `users`: User accounts with authentication
- `stock`: Inventory management with available/reserved quantities
- `reservations`: Product reservation system with status tracking

### FULLTEXT Index Creation ‚ö°

A composite FULLTEXT index is created on the `name` and `description` columns:

```sql
ALTER TABLE products
ADD FULLTEXT name_description (name, description);
```

### Search Query üîç

The implementation demonstrates searching for products using natural language mode:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE MATCH(name, description) AGAINST (
    'Sauce' IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE
);
```

**Sample Results:**
This query would find products such as:

- `Honey Garlic Sauce` - "A delicious sauce perfect for stir-frying or glazing meats"
- `Sweet Chili Sauce` - "A sweet and spicy sauce, great for dipping or cooking"
- `Ranch Dressing` - "Creamy ranch dressing, perfect for salads and dips"
- `Barbecue Chicken Pizza` - "Pizza topped with barbecue chicken, cheese, and red onions"

## Features ‚ú®

- **Natural Language Search**: Uses MySQL's natural language mode for intuitive text searches üó£Ô∏è
- **Multi-Column Search**: Searches across both product name and description simultaneously üßÆ
- **Relevance Scoring**: Results are automatically sorted by relevance to the search term üìä

## Benefits ‚úÖ

1. **Performance**: FULLTEXT indexes provide faster search compared to `LIKE '%term%'` queries ‚ö°
2. **Relevance**: Built-in relevance scoring ensures most relevant results appear first üéØ
3. **Flexibility**: Supports various search modes (natural language, boolean, query expansion) üîÑ

## Usage Examples üí°

### Basic Sauce Search

```sql
SELECT uuid, name, description, price
FROM products
WHERE MATCH(name, description) AGAINST ('Sauce' IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE);
```

### Multi-term Search

```sql
SELECT uuid, name, description, price
FROM products
WHERE MATCH(name, description) AGAINST ('chicken barbecue' IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE);
```

### Boolean Mode Search

```sql
SELECT uuid, name, description, price
FROM products
WHERE MATCH(name, description) AGAINST ('+sauce -spicy' IN BOOLEAN MODE);
```

## Advanced Search Modes üîç

### Natural Language Mode (Default)

```sql
WHERE MATCH(name, description) AGAINST ('delicious sauce' IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE);
```

- Automatically ranks results by relevance
- Supports multiple words and phrases
- Best for user-friendly searches

### Boolean Mode

```sql
WHERE MATCH(name, description) AGAINST ('+sauce -spicy +chicken' IN BOOLEAN MODE);
```

- **+** = word must be present
- **-** = word must not be present
- **""** = exact phrase matching
- \*\*\*= wildcard matching

### Query Expansion Mode

```sql
WHERE MATCH(name, description) AGAINST ('sauce' WITH QUERY EXPANSION);
```

- Finds additional relevant results by expanding the search
- Useful for finding related terms automatically

## Performance Considerations ‚ö°

- **Index Size**: FULLTEXT indexes require additional storage space
- **Update Performance**: Insertions and updates may be slower due to index maintenance
- **Search Speed**: Dramatically faster than LIKE '%term%' queries on large datasets
- **Memory Usage**: Indexes are loaded into memory for optimal performance
