# FULLTEXT Search Implementation 🚀

This project demonstrates the implementation of MySQL's FULLTEXT search functionality for efficient text-based queries on product data.

## Overview 📖

FULLTEXT search is a MySQL feature that allows for fast and efficient searching of text content within columns. It's particularly useful for searching large amounts of text data and provides better performance than traditional `LIKE` queries.

## Implementation Details 🛠️

### Database Schema 🗄️

The implementation uses a `products` table with the following structure:
- `uuid`: Primary key 🔑
- `name`: Product name (VARCHAR) 🏷️
- `description`: Product description (TEXT) 📝
- `price`: Product price 💲

### FULLTEXT Index Creation ⚡

A composite FULLTEXT index is created on the `name` and `description` columns:

```sql
ALTER TABLE products
ADD FULLTEXT name_description (name, description);
```

### Search Query 🔍

The implementation demonstrates searching for products using natural language mode:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE MATCH(name, description) AGAINST (
    'Sauce' IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE
);
```

## Features ✨

- **Natural Language Search**: Uses MySQL's natural language mode for intuitive text searches 🗣️
- **Multi-Column Search**: Searches across both product name and description simultaneously 🧮
- **Relevance Scoring**: Results are automatically sorted by relevance to the search term 📊

## Benefits ✅

1. **Performance**: FULLTEXT indexes provide faster search compared to `LIKE '%term%'` queries ⚡
2. **Relevance**: Built-in relevance scoring ensures most relevant results appear first 🎯
3. **Flexibility**: Supports various search modes (natural language, boolean, query expansion) 🔄

## Usage Example 💡

To search for products containing "Sauce":
```sql
SELECT uuid, name, description, price
FROM products
WHERE MATCH(name, description) AGAINST ('Sauce' IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE);
```

## Cleanup 🧹

To remove the FULLTEXT index:
```sql
ALTER TABLE products DROP INDEX name_description;
```

## Requirements 📋

- MySQL 5.6+ (for InnoDB FULLTEXT support) 🐬
- Minimum word length: 4 characters (default MySQL setting) 🔢
- Text columns must be of type CHAR, VARCHAR, or TEXT 📝
